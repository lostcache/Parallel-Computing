description: "The radical shift towards massive parallelism with Danny Hillis's Connection Machine and the data parallel model."

While Seymour Cray was perfecting his monolithic masterpieces, a radically different philosophy was taking shape in the halls of academia. This new vision challenged the very foundation of the Cray approach, arguing that the path to greater performance lay not in making a single processor ever faster, but in harnessing the collective power of thousands—or even millions—of simple processors working in concert. This was the dawn of Massively Parallel Processing (MPP).

##### **A Radical New Vision: The Connection Machine**

The central figure of the MPP era was W. Daniel "Danny" Hillis. In his doctoral research at MIT in the early 1980s, Hillis proposed a computing architecture that was a direct challenge to the sequential von Neumann model.[^4] Inspired by the structure of the human brain, he envisioned a machine composed of a vast number of simple, interconnected processing elements, all operating in parallel. In 1983, Hillis co-founded Thinking Machines Corporation (TMC) to turn this vision into reality.[^22] Their corporate motto captured the ambition of the project: "We are building a machine that will be proud of us".[^24]
The philosophy of the Connection Machine was a direct co-design of hardware and a new programming paradigm. Unlike the Cray-1, which was a hardware marvel that software had to adapt to, the Connection Machine was built from the ground up to execute a specific conceptual model: data parallelism.

##### **The Data Parallel Model**

The core idea behind data parallelism is to structure the computation to mirror the structure of the data itself.[^25] Instead of processing a large dataset with a single powerful processor that loops through each element one by one, the data parallel model assigns a single, simple processor to each data element.[^25] For a problem like image processing, one could imagine a processor for every pixel; for a neural network, a processor for every synapse.[^28] An operation, such as increasing the brightness of an image, could then be performed by all processors simultaneously. This approach was seen as a more natural and efficient way to express parallelism for a wide class of data-intensive problems, particularly in artificial intelligence, simulation, and symbolic processing.[^4] To support this model, TMC developed new programming languages, such as C* and *Lisp (Star Lisp), which had constructs to express data parallel operations natively.[^4]

##### **Architectural Deep Dive: The Connection Machine Series**

CM-1 (1986) and CM-2 (1987): The Hypercube Army
The first commercial manifestations of Hillis's vision were the Connection Machine CM-1 and its successor, the CM-2. These machines were marvels of complexity and ambition. A full-scale system contained up to 65,536 extremely simple, custom-designed one-bit processors.[^4] Each processor had its own small local memory (initially 4 kilobits, later expanded to 64 kilobits) and operated in a Single Instruction, Multiple Data (SIMD) fashion: a central controller, called a sequencer, would broadcast a single instruction that all 65,536 processors would execute simultaneously on their local data.[^4]
The true innovation, however, lay not in the processors themselves but in the network that connected them—hence the name "Connection Machine".[^5] The processors were arranged in a 12-dimensional hypercube topology, a complex network that provided a rich and efficient communication path between any two nodes in the system.[^4] This high-speed interconnect was critical for problems where data elements needed to frequently exchange information with their neighbors. Recognizing the need for scientific computing power, the CM-2 added floating-point co-processors, with every 32 one-bit processors sharing a single powerful floating-point unit.[^21]
The physical design of the CM-1 and CM-2 was as striking as its architecture. The machine was housed in a 1.5-meter cube-of-cubes, a visual reference to its internal hypercube network.[^4] Through the dark smoked-glass doors, one could see arrays of blinking red LEDs, one for each processor, which would light up when active. In a perfectly data-parallel program, the goal was to see a solid field of red light, indicating all processors were working in unison.[^4] The project's intellectual gravity attracted luminaries from across the scientific world, most notably the Nobel laureate physicist Richard Feynman, who famously helped TMC engineers optimize the design of the hypercube's routing hardware and developed novel algorithms for the machine.[^4]
CM-5 (1991): The Pivot to MIMD
By the early 1990s, the economics of the microprocessor industry were undergoing a seismic shift. The performance of commodity Reduced Instruction Set Computing (RISC) processors, such as the SPARC chip from Sun Microsystems, was improving at a phenomenal rate.[^7] TMC recognized that it was becoming more efficient to aggregate these powerful off-the-shelf chips than to continue designing its own custom one-bit processors. This pragmatic adaptation to market forces led to a major architectural pivot with the Connection Machine CM-5.[^4]
The CM-5 abandoned the SIMD architecture of its predecessors in favor of a Multiple Instruction, Multiple Data (MIMD) design.[^21] Instead of tens of thousands of simple processors, the CM-5 was built from hundreds or thousands of full-fledged SPARC RISC processors, each capable of executing its own independent instruction stream.[^4] The interconnect also evolved; the hypercube was replaced by a scalable "fat tree" network, which was better suited to the communication patterns of a MIMD architecture.[^21] Though the underlying hardware was MIMD, it was designed to efficiently simulate the SIMD model, simplifying programming and maintaining continuity with the data parallel paradigm.[^4]

##### **Impact and Legacy: Proving Massive Parallelism**

The Connection Machine series ultimately proved the viability of the massively parallel approach. While TMC filed for bankruptcy in 1994, a victim of shifting government funding priorities after the Cold War, its influence was profound.[^5] The CM-2 and CM-5 were used for groundbreaking work in fields like oil reservoir simulation, quantum chromodynamics, and molecular dynamics.[^31] In 1993, a CM-5 system was ranked as the fastest computer in the world, a powerful validation of the MPP concept at the highest level of performance.[^4] The ideas pioneered by Thinking Machines—data parallel programming, sophisticated interconnection networks, and the use of massive numbers of processors—laid the conceptual groundwork for the next generation of supercomputers and demonstrated that there was more than one way to climb the mountain of high-performance computing.
