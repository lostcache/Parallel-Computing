In the landscape of high-performance computing during the 1980s, a paradigm shift occurred, moving away from the monolithic vector supercomputers towards Massively Parallel Processing (MPP). The MPP philosophy was that computational power could be scaled by using a large number of simple processors, rather than a single, complex processor.[^4] This section examines the rise of MPP through a case study of a key example: the Connection Machine.

### Case Study: The Connection Machine

The development of the Connection Machine at Thinking Machines Corporation (TMC), co-founded by W. Daniel "Danny" Hillis in 1983, differed from the prevailing von Neumann architecture.[^22] Hillis's doctoral research at MIT formed the basis for a machine designed for data-parallel computation.[^4]

> **Defining Data Parallelism**
>
> The data parallel model is a programming paradigm in which parallelism is achieved by applying the same operation simultaneously to all elements of a large dataset. Instead of a single processor iterating through the data, the model assigns a simple processing element to each data point, allowing for parallel execution.[^25] This approach is particularly well-suited for problems with inherent data regularity, such as image processing, scientific simulations, and neural network training.[^28]

To support this model, TMC developed specialized programming languages, including C* and *Lisp, which provided high-level constructs for expressing data-parallel operations, abstracting the architectural complexity from the programmer.[^4]

### Architectural Evolution: The Connection Machine Series

The Connection Machine series underwent a significant architectural evolution, reflecting both the maturation of the MPP concept and the changing economics of the microprocessor market.

#### **CM-1 and CM-2: The SIMD Hypercube**

The initial models, the CM-1 and CM-2, were an embodiment of Hillis's original vision. Their key architectural features included:

*   **Massive Parallelism:** A full system contained 65,536 simple, bit-serial processors.
*   **SIMD Execution:** A central sequencer broadcast a single instruction to all processors, which executed it synchronously on their local data. This model was highly efficient for uniform operations across large datasets.
*   **Hypercube Interconnect:** The processors were connected in a 12-dimensional hypercube topology. This network provided high-bandwidth, low-latency communication, which is important for algorithms requiring frequent data exchange between processors.[^5]
*   **Floating-Point Enhancement (CM-2):** The CM-2 augmented the architecture by adding a Weitek 3132 floating-point unit for every 32 processors, significantly improving performance on scientific and engineering calculations.[^21]

The physical design was a cube composed of smaller cubes, with LEDs indicating processor activity.[^4]

#### **CM-5: Shift to MIMD and Commodity Processors**

The CM-5 marked a strategic change in response to the rapid performance gains of commodity RISC microprocessors.[^7]

*   **MIMD Architecture:** The custom bit-serial processors were replaced with hundreds or thousands of standard Sun SPARC RISC processors. Each processor could execute an independent instruction stream, making the system a MIMD machine.[^21]
*   **"Fat Tree" Network:** The hypercube was replaced with a scalable "fat tree" topology, which provided high bisection bandwidth and was better suited to the more varied communication patterns of a MIMD architecture.[^21]
*   **Programming Continuity:** Despite the underlying MIMD hardware, the system was designed to efficiently support the data-parallel programming model, ensuring software continuity and simplifying the transition for developers.[^4]

### Impact and Legacy

While Thinking Machines Corporation ultimately filed for bankruptcy in 1994, the Connection Machine series had a significant impact on high-performance computing.

*   **Demonstration of MPP Viability:** The CM series demonstrated that massively parallel architectures could achieve performance comparable or superior to traditional vector supercomputers for certain applications. A CM-5 was ranked the world's fastest computer in 1993.[^4]
*   **Popularizing Data Parallelism:** It popularized the data-parallel programming model, which remains a key concept in modern parallel computing, particularly in the context of GPUs.
*   **Influence on Interconnects:** The hypercube and fat tree networks led to research and development in high-performance interconnects, a critical component of all modern supercomputers.
*   **Scientific Applications:** CM-2 and CM-5 systems were used to advance research in fields such as quantum chromodynamics, oil reservoir simulation, and molecular dynamics.[^31]

The concepts developed by TMC provided a foundation for subsequent supercomputer designs, demonstrating the viability of large-scale parallelism.
