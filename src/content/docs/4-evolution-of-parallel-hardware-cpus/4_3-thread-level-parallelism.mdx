The limitations of the power wall and the diminishing returns of instruction-level parallelism marked a significant turning point in microprocessor design. With clock speeds stalled, the industry pivoted toward **Thread-Level Parallelism (TLP)** as the primary method for performance growth. TLP differs from ILP and DLP; it executes separate instruction streams—or threads—concurrently.[^19] This shift from a single fast core to multiple cores on a single chip marked the beginning of the multi-core era.

The most direct implementation of TLP is **Chip Multiprocessing (CMP)**, more commonly known as multi-core architecture. The concept is to use the increasing transistor budget provided by Moore's Law not to build a single, more complex monolithic core, but to place multiple, independent processor cores onto a single silicon die.[^7] Each core has its own architectural state and can execute a separate thread, with the operating system scheduling tasks across the available cores.

The transition to multi-core processors in the consumer market happened rapidly in the mid-2000s, following the limitations of the NetBurst architecture. AMD was the first to market with a mainstream desktop dual-core processor, the **Athlon 64 X2**, in April 2005.[^26] Intel followed with its own dual-core offerings, initially with the Pentium D, a Multi-Chip Module (MCM) design that placed two separate Pentium 4 dies on a single package.[^16] Intel's Core 2 Duo was released in July 2006. Based on the new Core microarchitecture, it marked an abandonment of the NetBurst philosophy and delivered superior performance at lower power consumption.[^16] This initiated a trend of increasing core counts. Intel launched the first desktop quad-core processor, the **Core 2 Quad QX6700**, in November 2006. This was an MCM design, packaging two dual-core dies together.[^29] AMD followed in 2007 with its first monolithic quad-core design, the Phenom processor.[^26]

While CMP exploits TLP by replicating entire cores, another technique, **Simultaneous Multithreading (SMT)**, achieves TLP *within* a single core. SMT is an architectural synthesis that uses the hardware originally built to exploit ILP to execute TLP. A modern superscalar, out-of-order core has many execution units, but a single thread often cannot provide enough ILP to keep all of them busy. This leads to underutilized resources, both in the form of unused execution slots within a single clock cycle ("horizontal waste") and entire cycles where the pipeline is stalled waiting for a long-latency event like a cache miss ("vertical waste").[^24]

SMT addresses this inefficiency. An SMT-capable core duplicates the architectural state—primarily the register file and program counter—for multiple hardware threads. The operating system sees this single physical core as two (or more) logical processors. The core's front-end fetches instructions from these multiple threads, and the out-of-order execution engine treats them as a single, larger pool of instructions. When one thread stalls, the scheduler can issue instructions from another thread to fill idle execution slots.[^19] SMT converts TLP into ILP for the execution engine, improving throughput and resource utilization.[^36] The hardware cost for this performance increase is small, estimated by some architects to be less than 5% of the total core area, as it reuses the majority of the out-of-order logic already present.[^37] Intel's implementation of SMT is **Hyper-Threading Technology**, first introduced with the NetBurst architecture and later refined for the modern Core processor family.[^13]

The shift to TLP had a significant consequence: it transferred the primary burden of performance optimization from the hardware architect to the software developer. To take advantage of a new quad-core processor, a program had to be explicitly written to use four threads. This is described by **Amdahl's Law**, which states that the maximum speedup achievable by parallelizing a task is limited by the portion of the task that is inherently sequential. If 25% of a program must run serially, then even with an infinite number of processors, the maximum possible speedup is only 4x.[^19] This underscored the importance of parallel programming models (like OpenMP and Pthreads), new programming languages, and a change in algorithm design to effectively utilize multi-core hardware.[^19]
